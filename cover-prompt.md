Subtitle: 让 Agent 稳定交付

Visual composition:
- Main visual: a clean hand-drawn network routing / metro map illustration. A central hub node labeled "Skill Router" connects to multiple small nodes labeled with simple words like "skills", "registry", "workflow", "confirm". Lines are thin, geometric, slightly hand-drawn, with subtle glow accents. Include a small "routing table" card UI element (very minimal, no tiny text).
- Layout: 16:9 cover. Title text large and highly readable, placed in the upper-left or center-left. Main visual occupies center-right. Leave generous negative space so it works at small thumbnail size.
- Decorative elements: minimal circuit traces, dots, and arrows; no clutter; no dense text.

Color scheme:
- Primary: neon green accents (#2CFF7A)
- Background: deep navy / near-black (#0B1020)
- Accent: white linework (#F2F5FF) and a small warm highlight (#FFCC66) sparingly

Style notes:
- Hand-drawn but modern, clean, and techy. High contrast. No photorealism.
- Make the Chinese title text crisp and readable.
- Avoid extra copy and avoid tiny text. Keep it elegant, minimal, and instantly understandable.
